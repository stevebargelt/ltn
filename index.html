                        Thank you for your interest in renting a tub from Labor Tubs NW. The last active
                        partner has retired, so our services are no longer available. We are in the process
                        of finding new owners, so please check back over the course of the next few months.
                        <br /> Sincerely, April, Kris, Brenna, and Heidi
                </p>
