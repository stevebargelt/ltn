        <p>Many parents find that warm water immersion during labor enhances relaxation and improves the birthing experience.  Whether a parent is interested in using water for support during labor, or in an actual water birth, Labor Tubs Northwest has 17 years of experience helping them find the right tub options for their individual birth experience.</p>
        <p>Labor Tubs Northwest delivers beautiful and sturdy AquaDoula birthing tubs to homes, hospitals, and birthing centers throughout the Greater Seattle area.  Specially designed for labor with the help of midwives and doulas from Seattle’s birth community, AquaDoula tubs are unique in their ability to comfortably accommodate 2 people and a variety of labor positions, while maintaining the water temperature in the tub.</p>                    
        <p>Beyond our normal delivery service, we also offer a variety of rental options for parents who expect a fast birth, have limited space, or live in outlying communities.</p>
        <p></p>

            <p>Our comprehensive service includes on-call 24-hour delivery, set-up and phone support, as well as complete cleaning, disinfection, and removal of the tub following birth.  Our cleaning protocol has been approved by several hospitals, for the safety of our clients and their babies.
</p>
            <p>For a home birth we usually we ask that you page us for the delivery before active labor starts.  If you have a small hot water heater, rush-hour traffic is approaching, your water breaks, or your midwife sees last-minute signs that suggest a fast labor, then we can be flexible!  Depending on the circumstances, we may even set the tub up a few days before your due date, and leave it ready to fill.</p>
            <p>Occasionally a labor stalls, or lasts longer than the water is safe from bacteria.  In the event this occurs, we will come empty the tub and provide a clean liner at no additional charge.</p>

At no extra charge, we provide a clean liner, pump, and hose in case you have a false start and need to empty the tub before the birth.

            <p>Sometimes our full-service rentals just aren’t the right answer for a family, so we offer a do-it-yourself option.  Our 30-day DIY rental kits offer you the peace of mind that comes from knowing your tub has been disinfected following the same great hospital-approved protocol our full-service rentals offer, along with modest savings from doing the work yourself.</p>
            <p>Clients pick up their DIY birth tub kits by appointment at a convenient location in North Seattle.  When you finish with the tub, you return it by appointment to the same location.  </p>
            <p>We provide easy, step-by-step instructions for setting up the tub.  It requires a bit of patience and some coaxing, but no great strength.  Filling the tub requires mindfulness of the water temperature at all times that the water is running, so that when it’s full it will be a safe, comfortable temperature for parent and baby.  Once it’s full, the heater will maintain the water temperature.</p>
            <p>Following your baby’s birth, you unplug the heater and use the disposable net to scoop out any “stuff”* that might clog the drain or pump.  Then the quick and quiet utility pump we provide makes it easy to drain the tub into your toilet.  Sometimes the water is pretty clear, even after a water birth.  Other times… to be honest, you need to have a strong stomach.</p>
            <p>Some families know in advance that they don’t want to handle the clean-up and return of the tub following the birth.  Other families decide after the birth that they are too tired to handle it.  Either way, our “Second Thought” clean-up service allows you to page us and have our on-call person come pump out the tub, disinfect it, pack it, and take it away.
