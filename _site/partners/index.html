<h5>From our business plan:</h5>

<strong>Company Overview:</strong>

<p>Labor Tubs Northwest (LTN) is a growing, home-based business which is owned and operated by a limited liability partnership(LLP) based in Seattle, Washington.  LTN provides full-service rentals of specially designed labor tubs to parents who are giving birth. Our service includes delivery, setup, support, takedown, and removal of tubs, for both home and hospital births.  We are on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Our primary service area stretches from Everett to Kent, and from the Puget Sound east along the major highway corridors.</p>

<p>LTN was established in July ‘99.  We purchased the rental tub business, primarily consisting of 4 AquaDoula tubs and “goodwill” in the birthing community, from Birth and Beyond, a Seattle-based retail operation which operated the tub rental and delivery service successfully for 5 years. </p>

<p>As our children got older and other family challenges arose, some of our original partners moved on to other work, without replacing themselves.  Kris remains involved as our bookkeeper, and does occasional fill-in work for emergencies.  April has remained on-call throughout the 15 years, with the assistance of various friends, and hopes to continue as an active partner for the next 2 – 5 years, until retirement.</p>

<p>The business has been in a “holding pattern” for a number of years, and seeks the energy and commitment of new partners to continue to grow and thrive in the years ahead.</p>

<strong>Mission Statement:</strong>

<p>Labor Tubs Northwest is committed to building a cooperatively run, family-friendly business that provides outstanding service to our clients and fair compensation for our work and investment, and which allows us the flexibility to maintain our family lives.</p>
    
<strong>Operating principles:</strong>

<p>The partners in Labor Tubs Northwest are committed to helping each other maintain a healthy personal and family life.  Our work style is casual and cooperative, and we try to reach consensus whenever possible in decision-making.  We are also pragmatic:  when consensus is not possible, the majority rules.</p>

<p>Our casual style is balanced by a formal approach to business issues such as accounting, insurance, taxes and licenses.</p>
  
<strong>Business structure:</strong>

<p>Our strength and growth potential stems from our partnership structure, which is key to maintaining our round-the-clock delivery schedule.</p>

<p>Each partner rotates time “on call”, which involves pick up and delivery of tubs and related record-keeping.  We also rotate coverage as “back up”, which involves covering for illness and emergencies, and divide other responsibilities such as office operations, data-base and website work, equipment maintenance, advertising and outreach.</p>

<strong>Business Goals and Objectives:</strong>

<p>The overriding goal of our partnership is to create part-time jobs for ourselves doing worthwhile work, with fair compensation for our time and investment, and the flexibility to accommodate our family lives.</p>

<p>For each partner this means something a bit different in terms of the number of hours we wish to work and the total compensation we need.</p>

<h5>Your Role as a Partner</h5>

<ol class="list-style list-decimal">
    <li><p>Commitment to being “on-call” for deliveries and pick-ups, carrying a pager, for 7 – 10 days a month.  Along with the pager you have the Sienna mini-van to drive, and our reservation book.  You are paid for each delivery, pick-up, or water change you do.</p>

    <p>Unlike midwives and doulas, most of our calls take between 2 and 3 hours, depending primarily on location and traffic.  Several times a year we’ll have back-to-back calls, or be up all night, but it is not the norm.</p>

    <p>Tub deliveries and pick-ups are very physical work.  While the equipment isn’t particularly heavy, it is very bulky and awkward to carry.  Many deliveries involve multiple trips up and down stairs with the equipment.  Both set-up and clean-up involve bending and stretching.  Clean-up may also involve blood, feces, and “baby goo” in the water, so you should either be comfortable, or prepared to become comfortable, with a “yuck” factor.</p>

    <p>There is flexibility in scheduling time on-call, especially if you live near other partners so that trading off the van is easy.  We also try to provide “high alert” coverage for each other, for things like dental appointments, performances, and such, that may come up during the on-call period.  For high alert coverage we don’t actually trade off the van, but a back-up person is prepared to take the van and do a delivery if needed.</p>
    </li>

    <li><p>Willingness to do “back up” coverage 7 - 10 days a month, primarily to cover illness for the person on-call.  The back-up person may also choose to handle extended deliveries (by appointment) in outlying areas.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Participate in all aspects of planning and decision-making, and agreed share of administration, equipment maintenance, etc.  Initially we rotated everything on a regular basis, so that we were all familiar with all aspects of the business, from phone calls to liner purchase.   Together we may decide to return to a rotational system, or we may agree on a different system to divide the work.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h5>How much will it cost?</h5>

<p>Each partnership share is offered at $3500.  Your payment would buy out either Heidi or Brenna’s share of the business.</p>

<h5>I’m interested, so what’s next?</h5>

<p>Please send us an email!  Our address is <a href="mailto:info@labortubs.com">info@labortubs.com</a>.
    <ul class="list-style list-circle">
        <li>Tell us a bit about yourself</li>
        <li>Feel free to attach a resume, weblink, or such, if you have them</li>
        <li>Outline 3 or 4 questions about our business, and how you might fit</li>
        <li>Let us know the best times to call you for a chat</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>One of us will call you, and set up a time to get together for coffee or tea.  We’ll be happy to answer as many questions as you have about the business.  If it feels like it would be a good fit, our balance sheet and financial statement will be made available, and we will arrange to take you along on a tub call, to get a feel for what it is like.</p>

<p><strong>We look forward to hearing from you!</strong></p>
