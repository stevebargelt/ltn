        <div class="row">
            <p>We recommend starting your reservation at least four to six weeks prior to your due date, so that all of the paperwork has time to go round-trip, and we’ll have directions in the van if baby decides to arrive early.   </p>
            <p>You are under no obligation to confirm the reservation, but it helps if we have some basic information about you and your birth plan, so that we can suggest how to best tailor our services to your particular situation.  After we have your information, we’ll send you a registration packet, which includes a copy of our rental agreement that will outline the agreed services. We ask that you return the rental agreement to us by mail, along with your payment.  After we receive your contract, we will follow up with a confirmation letter that includes instructions on paging for the tub delivery, or picking up your birth pool kit.</p>                    
            <p>While early reservations are helpful, we will expedite the process for parents who  contact us within a month of their due date.  No matter how close the due date, our 24-hour pager and 17 years of experience make last-minute reservations work! </p>

A client who cancels less than 14 days before her due date, who does not request delivery of a reserved tub, or whose labor situation prevents us from setting up a tub after arrival, is refunded the amount paid less $50.</p>
            <p>On rare occasions when our out-of-pocket cost for an attempted delivery exceeds $50, we will refund your full payment less our out-of-pocket cost for labor, mileage, and tolls.</p>

LTN is not responsible for any circumstances beyond their control of (i.e., complications of pregnancy, fast labor, midwife did not end up using the tub, etc.).  A refund of the amount paid, less the $50 non-refundable reservation fee, will be given for rentals canceled before pick-up.</p>
